# Reddit Post: Martingale Trading Bot

**Title:** Built a DCA/Martingale bot with some actual safety features - roast my strategy?

Hey everyone,

Yeah yeah, I know - Martingale strategies are basically gambling with extra steps and everyone here hates them. I get it. But hear me out for a sec.

I've been working on a crypto trading bot that uses a martingale-style averaging strategy, but with a bunch of safety mechanisms to avoid the classic "blow up your account" problem that these systems are infamous for.

**The Strategy (TLDR):**
- Only enters when price is BELOW 1h EMA100 (dip-buying, not chasing pumps)
- Adds to losing positions with increasing size (the martingale part)
- Uses dynamic position tapering - as you approach the margin cap, order sizes shrink exponentially to avoid hitting the wall
- Takes profits at 10% gains on the position
- Has a 50% margin cap with smart tapering so you never actually hit it

**Safety Features:**
- Volatility filters (can be toggled) for BB bands and historical volatility
- Decline velocity detection - won't add during crashes, only controlled dips
- Liquidation protection via margin monitoring
- The tapering thing I mentioned - this is key. Instead of going all-in and getting liquidated, it smoothly reduces position sizes as margin increases

**Backtesting:**
I've been running backtests on 1-minute data over 7-180 day periods. Some pairs do great (+127% on HBAR over 34 days), others... not so much. The ones that sideways-to-up trend perform well. The ones that dump hard obviously struggle, even with the protections.

The dynamic tapering seems to help a lot - it prevents the "slow bleed into liquidation" problem by keeping you active but not overleveraged.

**I know this is controversial** - martingale strategies are rightfully criticized. But I'm curious if anyone has suggestions for improvements? Things I should add/remove? Better entry conditions? Different profit-taking strategies?

I'm not trying to sell anything or claim this is some holy grail. Just sharing what I've built and genuinely curious what more experienced traders think could make this less terrible.

Also yes, I'm testing on testnet first before going live with real money. I'm enthusiastic but not completely insane.

Thoughts?

## Key Points to Mention in Comments

If people ask for more details:

1. **Why dip-buying (below EMA100)?**
   - Martingale works better on mean reversion than trend following
   - Buying dips gives better entry prices with more upside potential
   - Avoids FOMO entries when price is already extended

2. **How does tapering work exactly?**
   - Formula: `taper_factor = ((max_margin - current_margin) / max_margin) ^ 2`
   - Example: At 0% margin usage = 100% order size, at 25% = 56% size, at 40% = 4% size, at 50% = 0% size
   - Creates a buffer for volatility while staying active

3. **What about the decline velocity thing?**
   - Analyzes short-term (5 periods), medium-term (15 periods), and long-term (30 periods) rate of change
   - Distinguishes between healthy pullbacks (GOOD for martingale) and crashes (BAD)
   - Won't add during fast declines or panic selling

4. **Backtesting methodology:**
   - Checks every 5 minutes (matches real bot behavior)
   - Uses 1-minute candles for accurate price data
   - Includes all volatility protections and risk management
   - Simulates exact margin calculations with 10x leverage
   - Fees included (0.075% per trade)

5. **Why 10% profit target?**
   - On 10x leverage, 10% on the margin invested = 1% of the position's notional value
   - Small enough to hit regularly, large enough to be meaningful
   - Can be adjusted per user preference

## Potential Concerns to Address

**"Martingale will blow up your account eventually"**
- Correct! That's why we have:
  - Hard margin cap (50% by default)
  - Dynamic tapering (never actually hits the cap)
  - Volatility filters (can pause during extreme conditions)
  - Decline velocity detection (avoids knife-catching)

**"Past performance doesn't predict future results"**
- 100% agree. Backtesting helps understand behavior but doesn't guarantee profits
- This is why I'm testing on testnet first
- Different market conditions = different results

**"Why not just use a stop loss?"**
- Valid criticism! The whole point of martingale is averaging down
- A stop loss would defeat the strategy's core mechanism
- Instead, we use margin protection and tapering as "soft stops"

**"This only works in bull markets"**
- Partially true - sideways-to-up trends work best
- Strong downtrends are challenging even with protections
- That's why entry filtering (below EMA100) matters
